This project is born from the experience we made with one of our clients
for which we developed a solution for capturing and analysing metering
data from over half million of devices.

The tool became quickly a very important part of daily problem investigations,
and a cornerstone in the behavioral analysis.

The speed and the ability to interactively visualise the data made
the experience of extracting insights plesant and playful.

Due to the great success of the project we decided to turn the experiece
we acquired into an OpenSource project, and `Samsara` was born.
